# Different files relating to algorithms in Graph Theory.Different files relating to algorithms in Graph Theory. The module, Grafteori_module contains most of the raw code, whereas the file Grafteori_anvendelse gives different examples of using the function in the module. The program Euklidisk_DHP also gives nice randomized examples of some algorithms in the main module. 

# Note that most of the text in the files are in danish.
